                            <p>I got the demo for this game on some random collection of demos years ago. I had never heard anything about it but was blown away. I loved it so much I bought the full version as soon as it hit the shelves. Unfortunately it got lost in the market.</p>

                            <p>I remember playing the game with my friends when i was young. We had so many great times with the crashing in the game. The handling of the cars is the best any driving game has to offer. You'll have so much fun playing this. GET THIS GAME!</p>

                            <p>1nsane is very fast paced and fun racing arcade simulator. Cars feel great to drive, physics are good and adrenaline rush is constant. There's lots of cars and many game modes to select from. Game feels great even at 1player game. I think it will be insanely good as multiplayer and i'm sure that I will experience it soon as I've recommended it to all of my friends already. Graphics are decent do it's magic. It's bit outdated, true - but to be honest most of the time driving is so hectic and fun that there's no time to enjoy the views for prolonged periods.</p>
